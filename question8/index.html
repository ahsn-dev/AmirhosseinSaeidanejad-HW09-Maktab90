        <h2>Horse</h2>
        <p>
          The horse is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to
          the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of
          Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million
          years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large,
          single-toed animal of today.

        <h2>Donkey</h2>
        <p>
          The domestic donkey is a hoofed mammal in the family Equidae, the same
          family as the horse. It derives from the African wild ass, Equus
          africanus, and may be classified either as a subspecies thereof, Equus
          africanus asinus, or as a separate species, Equus asinus.
